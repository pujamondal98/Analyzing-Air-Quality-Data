# Analyzing-Air-Quality-Data
This repository contains a Python implementation of a system for analyzing air quality data. The system is based on the ARM Dataset, a publicly available air quality data dataset.
The system is implemented using the following Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and, Efficient Apriori.
The system first cleans the data and removes any null values. It then performs association analysis on the data to identify common patterns of pollutants. The system also generates visualizations of the data to help users understand the results of the analysis.
The system can be used to: #Identify the most common pollutants in the air #Identify patterns of pollutants that occur together #Generate visualizations of air quality data
The system is still under development, but it is already able to analyze air quality data with a high degree of accuracy. I plan to add more features to the system, such as the ability to predict air quality levels.
I hope you find this system useful!
